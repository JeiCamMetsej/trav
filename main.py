# The original game scenario was formulated in 1994 by Kaushik Basu and goes as follows:
# An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques.
# An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains that the airline is liable for a maximum of $100 per suitcase
# â€”he is unable to find out directly the price of the antiques.
# To determine an honest appraised value of the antiques, the manager separates both travelers so they can't confer,
# and asks them to write down the amount of their value at no less than $20 and no larger than $100.
# He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases
# and reimburse both travelers that amount. However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other,
# this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus:
# $10 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value and a $10 deduction will be taken from the person who wrote down the higher amount.
# The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should write down?
